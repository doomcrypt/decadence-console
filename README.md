# Decadence – CCRU Lemurian Time-Sorcery Simulator

Terminal-based card game loosely inspired by CCRU's Pandemonium Matrix, Decadology and time-sorcery numerics.

## How to play

- 5×2 card layout (Set-1 vs Set-2)
- Pair cards whose ranks sum to 10
- Special bonus points for certain pairs (1+9, 2+8, …)
- Unpaired cards in Set-1 give penalty = -rank
- Reach ≤ 0 cumulative score → aeon collapses → demon emerges

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doomcrypt/decadence.git
cd decadence
python3 decadence.py
